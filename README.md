# Trunk-Based-Developmen

Arguments for Trunk Based Development:

Faster Releases: Since the main branch is always production-ready, it's easier to release new features or fixes quickly.
Reduced Merge Conflicts: Frequent small merges reduce the likelihood of complex merge conflicts.
Simplified Workflow: It's a simpler workflow that can be efficient for smaller teams and organizations.


Arguments against Trunk Based Development:

Riskier for Unstable Changes: In larger teams, unstable changes can cause issues if merged into the main branch too soon.
Challenging for Long-Lived Features: It may not be ideal for projects with long-lived feature development, as changes must be merged quickly.
